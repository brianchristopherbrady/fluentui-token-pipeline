title: Fluent UI token pipeline

# Fluent UI token pipeline

The Fluent UI token pipeline transforms JSON files describing design tokens into source code for eventual use in the Fluent UI libraries.

It's currently a functional prototype, and is not yet designed for use beyond the Fluent UI libraries at this time. The actual token values in the `src/demo` folder are just examples, and they do not represent an evolution of Microsoft's design systems.
