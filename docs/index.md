# Fluent UI token pipeline

The Fluent UI token pipeline transforms JSON files describing design tokens into source code for eventual use in the Fluent UI libraries.

This tool was originally designed to process files in Microsoft's proprietary design token format. Our design token files are now in the [W3C Design Token Community Group](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) draft standard format, so this tool is no longer required to work with them.
